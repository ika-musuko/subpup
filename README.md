# Purpose
Stress and anxiety is a common problem for students everywhere. 
Studies have shown that hanging with dogs can help with that! 
But many students, and others too, whether because of space, money, or time, 
can't have a dog. To help with that, we've built Subpup, a platform to connect 
dog-less humans to the dogs around them.

# What it does
Subpup lets dog owners "sublet" or share their dogs to people without dogs for a few hours. 
Anyone who wants to hang with a dog can browse listings from dog owners and shelters in the 
area that are available at that moment or in the future.

# How we built it
We started by deciding what functions we needed, like browsing through dogs, 
filtering by time, rating experiences, cancelling appointments, and mapping out 
the user interface. A couple of us started designing the pages with HTML/CSS while 
the rest of us set up the backend and database with Python/Flask and SQLite.
